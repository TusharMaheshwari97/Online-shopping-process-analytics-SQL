-- 1.1.	Join all the tables and create a new table called combined_table.(market_fact, cust_dimen, orders_dimen, prod_dimen, shipping_dimen)
create table combined_table as select mf.*,

-- 2.	Find the top 3 customers who have the maximum number of orders
select distinct cust_id,customer_name,count(order_quantity) over(partition by cust_id) total_order

-- 3. Create a new column DaysTakenForDelivery that contains the date difference of Order_Date and Ship_Date.

update combined_table 
set Order_Date=str_to_date(Order_Date,"%d-%m-%Y");
alter table combined_table modify Order_Date date;

update combined_table set Ship_Date=str_to_date(Ship_Date,"%d-%m-%Y");

alter table combined_table modify Ship_Date date;

alter table combined_table add DaysTakenForDelivery int;

update combined_table set DaysTakenForDelivery = datediff(Ship_Date,Order_Date);

select * from combined_table;




-- 4. Find the customer whose order took the maximum time to get delivered

select cust_id,customer_name,DaysTakenForDelivery 
from combined_table order by DaysTakenForDelivery desc limit 1;


-- 5.Retrieve total sales made by each product from the data (use Windows function)

select distinct prod_id,sum(sales) over(partition by prod_id) as total 
from combined_table order by prod_id;


-- 6. Retrieve total profit made from each product from the data (use windows function)

select distinct prod_id,sum(profit) over(partition by prod_id) as `total profit` 
from combined_table;


-- 7. Count the total number of unique customers in January and how many of them came back every month over the entire year in 2011

select count(*) 'Total uniques customers' 
from (select distinct cust_id,customer_name from combined_table where month(order_date)=1 and year(order_date)=2011)t;

-- 8.	Retrieve month-by-month customer retention rate since the start of the business.(using views)

#Tips: 
#1: Create a view where each userâ€™s visits are logged by month, allowing for the possibility that these will have 
#occurred over multiple # years since whenever business started operations
# 2: Identify the time lapse between each visit. So, for each person and for each month, we see when the next visit is.
# 3: Calculate the time gaps between visits
# 4: categorise the customer with time gap 1 as retained, >1 as irregular and NULL as churned
# 5: calculate the retention month wise
